The Rift
======

Chapter 1
---------

The low hanging clouds on that dreary November day kept the lumbering airship out of view. No one in the miles leading to the town of Briersville saw it coming. No one heard it either. The silent structure of cloth and steel had crept through the cloud cover. It must have descended gradually, foot after foot until it managed to collide with the court house's radio tower.

The people in town hardly noticed it there, bobbing up and down, twisting side to side in the breeze. Then a brisk wind picked up, propelling the airship forward. The radio tower's metal struts whined. A woman on the sidewalk pushing a baby stroller looked up and screamed. People passing by stopped. A young couple rushed to her aid. A police car darted across the street and stopped, it's tires popping up over the curb.

The police officer, Office Doyle, jumped out and came to the woman's side. She seemed more interested in fleeing than in explaining what was happening. The young woman, dressed in a pressed white shirt and a green sweater kept saying, "Is your baby okay? Is she okay?"

Before the woman answered, though, they all looked up in unison, suddenly aware that the hulking mass of the airship was above them. It cancelled out everything in their immediate view. Stunned, even the woman didn't scream. No one moved, other people around them began to stop, wondering what could be so interseting to see. One by one, they looked up and saw the airship there. Soon the sidewalk was crowded with people. Cars were stopping in the road. A train that had left the station, stopped mid-track. As if sprouting from the windows, heads then whole torsos appeared in the windows along its length.

Officer Doyle was stunned as well. Usually one to spring into action, he rubbed the round of the hand across his forehead. He went to run his hand through his thinning hair—his usual response to stress and befuddlement —but pushed his hat off the back of his head and to the ground. The young man who had stopped earlier, bent to pick it up. 

"Here, Officer Doyle, here's your hat?"

"What's that?"

"Your hat, sit. It fell to the ground."

When the young man passed the rigid, structured hat back to Officer Doyle, the gesture or the hat reignited conscious thought in the officer. He looked around like someone waking up from a dream and realizing, to his horror, that he had sleep walked to the edge of a cliff. With the airship bobbing gleefully with each passing brush of wind, it was only a matter of time before it crash to the ground and exploded. Or exploded outright, he reminded himself.

"Okay, I need everyone to step back."

Much like the policeman, everyone else seemed too stunned or simply too curious to move. They didn't have the benefit of even the cursory training that Office Doyle received in Chicago. They hadn't imagined themselves gunning down thieves or engaging in high speed chases. Their imaginative reflexes simply weren't nearly as fine tuned as the policeman's. And the airship had overtaken his capacities with awe rather quickly.

"People, people. Move away. Cross the street. You..." He waved the young man who had picked up his hat, "Young man, come here. What's your name?"

"My name?" The young man shook his head, still trying to clear the strange image of the airship from his mind. "I'm Lonnie, sir." 

"Lonnie, you from around here?"

"No sir, I'm..."

The girl, whom he recognized, stepped forward, "He's my boyfriend. He's visiting."

Their bashfulness and hesitation seemed out of place in the current circumstances. Officer Doyle simply didn't register it, and merely proceeded on. "Good. Look, son, I need you to get out there and start getting those people in their cars to move. Got anything colorful?"

"I...I don't think so."

"Here," the policeman reached into his back pocket. "Take this kerchief. It's all I've got to spare right now. Clear a path. Keep the cars stopped, then we'll deal with them."

Lonnie looked down at the kerchief, then the road. Much like Office Doyle, the presence of these objects brought him back to consciousness. He dashed into the street and began waving the red kerchief.

"Everyone, I need you to cross the street," she shouted again.

The woman tipped her stroller down off the sidewalk and passed through the gap that Lonnie had managed to make with the help of the drivers. The girl, Lisa, began gently nudging people along too. Fortunately, once a few people started to move, the rest followed. They started circling the block, clearing the area.

It wasn't long afterwards that the fire department arrived. Three trucks in all. The other police squad cars appeared as well. Eveyone seemed to apepared at once. The men in uniforms jumped and dashed out of their vehicles. Then, one by one, they all came to a dead stop. Head after head tilted up, staring at the airship above them. Huddling happened next. Consultations. Gestures. 

The fire chief broke through the crowd on the other side of the street--he had walked from the station. The firefighters parted, letting him into the center of their group.

"Appeared out of nowhere..."

"It could blow any minute"

You could words like "Akron" and "Shendoah" rise from their ranks, those of them that remembered the fantastic crashes and explosions from that earlier era of aviation.

The police chief arrived with the mayor in tow, a woman as it turned out, and her assistant. The two chiefs and the mayor met and broke away, forming a separate group now to "talk this thing over"

"Is it stable? That's the main thing," the mayor asserted. "If it's not stable, we have a problem, don't we?"

"No way of knowing best I can tell," the fire chief explained.

"My man, Doyle, was first on the scene," the police chief said, apropos of nothing. The fire chief seemed irritated by the passing remark.

"We're ready to go up there, Mayor. It's your call," the police chief again.

The fire chief shifted his weight from side to side, looked back at his guys. He wasn't about to let the police chief upstage him here. He had lived in Briersville long before the police chief arrived on the scene. He knew people. And knowing people meant something.

The mayor interceded, "I don't want anyone going up there that isn't *experienced*," she said, managing to make both men irritated now. She had been a "professional" woman from the city not that long ago. She was more of an upstart than the police chief, as far as the fire chief was concerned. But they both accepted the logic of what she said. 

The fire chief rifled through the list of things he knew, of people that he knew. There had to be something or someone that could help out. Then he remembered something, the Plaice boy. He had been a war hero, or at least a veteran. The chief had to turn down his application to be a firefighter for...extenuating circumstance. But he had been a mountaineering solider, and lived in Colorado for some years.

"What about the Plaice boy..." he finally said, kicking at the sidewalk with the tip of his boot, and spitting off into the street.

"He's just a teenager!" the police chief objected.

"Not the young one. The older one."

"And why should we ask him," the mayor asked, leaning back on her left foot, ready for a round of verbal sparing. "Why should we ask a civilian to risk his life for this?"

"Well, he's a good boy. He'll do it."

"That's not what I asked," said the mayor.

"Sounds risky to me. Besides, we'd better clear it with the lawyer, " the police chief said.

"Bernie's on vacation."

"Can't we call him?" the mayor asked.

"Fly fishing..." That ended the discussion about that.

"So, what qualifies him for...whatever it is we're thinking about"

"He's a war veteran."

"I don't remember him from any of the parades or celebrations."

"No, he was too busy drinking and whoring in Colorado."

"I don't konw a thing about that."

"You aren't called out to the Keg every weekend."

The fire chief nodded at that. "True, true, but he wanted to a fire fighter..." He raised his hands to fend off objections. "And he fought in the mountains, in Italy during the war. He's a mountaineer. And did that in Colroado if memory serves."

"So, he can..."

"He can climb, madam Mayor. He can climb. He's got the gear and the skills."

"Well we can call the damn...excuse me Mayor...we can call the utility company out here to climb up there. They've got gear too."

"Sure, sure. But what would they do once they get up there?" They all turned to look up at the radio tower, scanning the heights of that gridwork of metal. It had seemed so stable and sturdy only a few hours ago, and now looked as delicate as a fine brocade of lace. You've got to gut up that tower, which seems to be hanging by a few bolts from the look of it, then you gotta grapple something onto the frame of that thing, shimmy up like some kind of monkey, get inside and have a look around. And who knows what's inside that thing!" The fire chief ended on a high note to punctuate his point. 

The mayor looked at the police chief. "Chief Nagel, do you have any objections?"

From the mayor's look and the police chief's sermon like discourse, the police chief knew that he was beat. He didn't have a better plan, and was secretely relieved that he didn't have to send one of his guys up there. Besides, the Plaices had always been a pain, so why not send a little something back their way. "No, madam, Mayor. I can't say that I do."

"Okay, then. Chief, please send one of your officers to retreive this Mr. Plaice."

"Nathaniel's his name, mayor."

"...to get Nathanial Plaice and inform him that his town kindly requests his help."

"And if he refuses?"

"I'm not sure exactly, chief. Be creative."

"Let's try to get these people home. I want downtown blocked off and baricaded. No one in here until we understand the situation better."

"Yes, mam," both men said, turning to their respective tasks.

Chapter 2
---------

Nathaniel Plaice wondered where his younger brother was. And his sister for that matter. No one was around, leaving him to finish chores around the house. The house always seemed to be in a state of disrepair. He might have caused some of it himself, but felt obligated to keep the appearance of things going. He learned quickly after moving back home that the appearances of things mattered in a way he didnt' understand anymore.

He resisted the urge to blame every strange or unsual on being at war. Hardly identified himself as a veteran, and couldn't much stand talk about units and regiments, fronts and advances. It sickened him all now. Fortunatly people around Briersville seemed to get over their war fever pretty quickly. Once the munitions factory closed down, that settled it for everyone.

A cold cup of coffee straddled the space between the countertop and the floor in the kitchen. He picked it up and immediately spit it out, finding his mouth full of wads of paper. Some queer thing his brother must be up to. Where was his brother? And his sister? 

The metalic whine of the screen door followed by a loud thwap sound announced the arrival of someone. His brother? No, two sets of feets. His sister. And her boyfriend, who was staying at the YMCA. "Nat! Nat! Are you here?"

"Yeah!" he shouted, roared really.

The two kids skidded into the kitchen. They look terrified and in awe, like someone who had just survived a bombardment, or ran through a field of machine gun fire untouched. 

"Did you hear?"

"Hear what?"

"About the airship. You didn't hear?"

The boyfriend chimed in, "This old airships, at least 50 years old..."

"Maybe 40", his sister corrected. 

"Maybe 40 years old got..."

"Snagged"

"Snagged on the radio tower in town."

"On top of the court house?"

"That's the one."

What were they going on about? He wondered. His sister, Lisa, was pacing the kitchen, full of more nervous energy than he had yet to see in her. She started in on her fingernails, biting and tearing at them. Her boyfriend, Lonnie, watched her. It was clear that his terror and awe all stemmed from her.

With his sister lost in thought about somethign, Nathaniel turned to the boyfriend, "Lonnie? Lonnie..." He snapped his fingers at him. "Tell me what's going on. I don't understand what you're talking about."

"Well, it's really peculiar."

"I get that..."

"I'm sorry. It just doesn't make sense. There's an airship, a rigid airship..."

"Dirigible..." Lisa inserted.

Lonnie was holding up one hand now, flat like a plane. "And the airship, up here, somehow came drifting down and..." Another hand represented the courthouse. "Then like that it get's snagged on the radio tower. And it doesn't blow up."

"It hasn't blown up?" Nathaniel asked.

"Not yet," Lisa replied, stepping into their conversation now. "But it could at any minute right? It's just a big gas cloud covered in metal. And even it doesn't blow up. What it just deflates and just, kind of, drapes itself over the town..."

"Like a blanket!" said Lonnie, though neither Plaice felt the figure quite captured it.

"But, Nathaniel, the realy puzzle is, where did this thing come from. I mean, an airhsip?"

"No one has really built a airship for twenty or thirty years," he said.

"Exactly. Has it just been floating up there in the sky for all this time, just waiting to come down."

"And why here, exactly?" asked Lonnie. Being the outsider, he didn't take it as a given that an enormous airship would appear anywhere else but Briersville. But he coudl readily imagine his own home town faced with the same circumstances. For all they knew every small town in America was facing the same crisis.

"Well," Nathaniel finally said, "It's not our problem, and you're safe, so let's move on, okay?" As if responding to him, they all turned at the distant sound of police sirens, sirens that came closer and closer to their house. The driver must have killed the sound at their entrance to long driveway that led off of the county road to the farmhouse where they lived. 

A knock on the door. Nathaniel went to answer with Lisa and Lonnie trailing behind him. It was Office Doyle again. "Officer Doyle, how can I help you?"

The police officer hardly acknowledged the two kids who had helped him out with the crowd earlier. "Afternoon. Probably heard about the airship in town."

"I did. My sister just came from there and told me about it. You making sure everyone hears about. Any roads closed."

"Oh sure. Downtown is barricaded for now. Not much going in and out."

"Hope that won't impact the businesses down there too much."

"Yeah, we'll see."

Officer Doyle seemed to forget the purpose of his visit. Behind him, the can shaped lights on his far rotated furiosuly, even though the sun and sky absorbed most of their light.

"But that's not the real reason I'm calling on you, Nathaniel."

As he removed his hat, Nathaniel realized that he needed to invite the officer in. "Why don't you come inside then."

"Don't mind if I do."

"Need anythign to drink, Officer Doyle?" Lisa asked.

"No thank young lady. Oh, you were outside the court house earlier."

"Yes, sir"

"Big help these two, right in the middle of the action." Nathaniel reaised an eyebrow at his sister, who deflected his inquisitive, irritated gesture, as she so often did.

"Let's sit down here in the parlor and talk over...what ever it is you came out here to talk about."

Officer Doyle turned his hat around and around in his hands. He sat on the edge of the long couch in the front parlor, his feet pitched far apart. He leaned forward with his elbows propped on his knees. "This is kind of a sensitive matter. And, I think speaking for everyone in town..." Nathaniel understood him to mean the mayor and the two chiefs, "...that it would be best to not go telling everyone what we talk about here."

Nathaniel nodded his head, not really to indicate that he understood anything, but just the fill the space between his confusion and his reluctance to hear whatever the police officer had to tell him.

"You see we have a...information problem on our hands."

"You might have more than that," Nathaniel replied.

"Yes, exactly. But, we don't know. We don't properly know." The police officer spoke with a far away, almost dreamy quality in his voice. Between his sister and her boyfriend, Nathaniel found fragments of an old poem floating back into his memory:

    'There was a ship,' quoth he.
    'Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!'
    Eftsoons his hand dropt he.

    He holds him with his glittering eye—`

Apparently these lines had been in his memory for years, though he hadn't recalled them before today. 

"And how can you help with your information problem, Office Doyle?"

"My superiors," whom Nathaniel knew to be the two chiefs and the mayor, "think you have a special skill that can be or services."

"Tending a rundown farm? Picking up after adolescent siblings? Or, maybe, being harrassed by the police for having a few drinks?"

"Well as to that last one you know we have certain rules on the books that have to be followed."

"Fine. But it sounds like you are going to ask me to do something that isn't a run of the mill request. So, I would apprecitate the courtesy of you just coming out to say it to me."

The office straightened himself out a bit, either uncomfortable or annoyed, Nathaniel couldn't say. "Yes, well, that skill involves your time in the army."

"Oh, so slogging through muddy fields, huddling in frozen mountain caves?"

"That last one. No, I mean your mountaineering skills. That's what we're talking about."

Nathaniel leaned back in his chair. "I see. And how exactly will those skills be useful to you?"

"Imagine this. Imagine a seesaw." Officer Doyle help one hand flat and upright in the air. He placed the other flat across it. "And that seesaw is rocking back and forth. This plank is just balanced on a pin point, nothing at all. Only that plank is metal and fabric and maybe filled with dangerous gas. But we don't know, and there's not many people who can climb up that pin point, which is really a 30 foot tall pin point that isn't safely secured anymore."

"That's what you're asking me to do, to climb up to this airship and see when and if it will explode over our town?"

"Yes, that's exactly it."

"And what if I refuse?"

"My boss' instructions were to be *creative*."

Chapter 3

"Who the hell is there?" The surly voice shot down from a platform high up in the trees above.

"It's me you asshole," replied Arthur.

"Got the smokes?"

"Yeah, I got 'em"

"Then come the hell on up"

A rope dropped and dangled unceremoniously in front of Arthur's face. He hated climbing up the rope ladder like some kind of army recruit. But he had to deliver the package to Jeff, Charlie, and the other guys.

When he finally scrambled up on to the plaform and stood up, three other guys hunched around him. One of them, Charlie, was stabbing the wood under his feet with a switchblade, then carving dirty words into it. The other two--Jeff and Nick--were laughing and saying "boobs" over and over again.

"You got it?" Charlie looked up from his woodworking.

"Yep," said Arthur. He took off a stiff green army knapsack. flipped it open, and took out a bundle wrapped in a red bandana. He untied the bandanna and took out two packages of cigarettes.

"Hey that's one open already!" complained Jeff, who was the tallest of the three.

"So!" said Arthur. He started to put the bundle back in his pack.

"Give it over, Paisley", their creative transformation of his last name. "That's not yours to give and take as you want. You owe us."

"It's a tithe," said Nick, who secretly was the smart one, probably as smart as Arthur, maybe as smart as his sister.

"A what?" said the other two.

"Nevermind, here. I could only lay my hands on these two. They're fresh though."

"We'll be the judge of that," said Charlie. He retrieved a banged up metal lighter--one that he claimed his father used in the war, and lit up one the cigarrettes. He inhaled and exhaled, brushing off little bits of tobacco left behind on his lips. "Pretty good." He passed the 

<!---
Parts
His legs hadn't been built for pews. The rise and fall of the seats always seemed too dramatic. The angle of the back too severe. And his legs\-\-too short by far, not optimized for the kneeling, not suited for the sitting. He had carried this physical discomfort in religious seating for a long time, since at least a time when he was younger and his mother had passed through a phase of religious interest. Calling it fervor would have done a disservice to his mother. He wouldn't corrupt this memory with inaccurate depictions. He had always prided himself on the accuracy, on the order, of his feelings.

He could put his feelings into such tidy arrangements, that even the memorial for his wife after her death could be parsed out into manageable actions. He had calmly agreed to the setting, to the tone of the service. It was simply a matter of following the letter of the law, the intentions set forth in his wife's will. Intentions he had nodded over at some time. Now those intentions were made manifest, his wife's spirit embodying itself in the plans that friends and family executed on that day, at that memorial. 

The people around him seemed perfectly settled into their places. Distant relatives from his wife's side came from miles away to pay their respects. They all seemed to know their roles, or to pick up perfectly news ones, with little prompting. Everyone sat and stood at the right times. Hymnals opened, pages flipped. Voices raised together. And he could hardly sit still through any of it.

The rebellion his body put up wasn't done as a conscious rebellion. He wasn't the sulking atheistic teenager that his wife had always taken him for. He had programmed that out of himself a long time ago. And yet that little variable, that little declaration made at some point, recurred throughout their relationship. Nevertheless, he couldn't help but feel there was some other intention at work here that made the seats uncomfortable, and the room a little too warm. Even the glare of the hymnals seemed to distract him in ways even he didn't fully understand and wasn't fully able to control.

The only distraction he found was tracing out the patterns in the old worn parquet flooring. The scuffs and scraps didn't quite have the poetry of the old Anglican pews, worn by dog leashes, that he and his wife had seen so long ago on vacation. But he was intent on following the orderly zigzag of the floor, then trace out the chaotic spirals and chopped up lines made countless numbers of heels over the years. He puzzled over the wear and tear, wondering if it was a sign of piety, of boredom, or revolt. Had people shuffled up and down those aisles every weekend. Did they shuffle away finding what they wanted and needed? Maybe kids dangling feet had done the work, another  accident of biology that the builders of the space had not foreseen.

At this point, the program for the memorial was tightly rolled up in his hands. He almost seemed to be strangling the thing as his hands clasped it, and kept is suspended between his knees. Fifteen minutes in to the ceremony, and he found that the had to perch at the edge of the pew. This kept his feet firmly planted on the floor, until he started to bounce on the balls of his feet. The roll ed up program jostled up and down as he did. His new brown shoes creaked around the toes as he did. 

Bouncing like this, his mother reached over to settle him, restrain him, really. The firm hand on his knees stopped the kinetic bouncing, but didn't really restrain the inner compulsion to expel the waves of energy inside him. The order of the day was to seem serene, so he did. In some ways he felt he owed this to his mother as much as to his wife. His wife had been possessed with the same kind of nervous energy as him, quick to bounce from idea to idea. Her conversations could be long detours through memories and thoughts. But now his mother imparted her focus on setting things in order on the day. The people, the flowers, the church, the clothes, the food, all of it showed up on this inauspicious day because his mother had willed it to.

From across the room, his wife's mother made a few glances in his direction, but seemed largely concerned with sisters and brothers from lives past. Their children and children's children were there too. Outside the church earlier, they had all exchanged pleasant condolences. One sister, a younger one who seemed to project herself as an outcast, stood off to the side smoking cigarette after cigarette. Her wiry, nervous hands waved away the clouds of smoke, but it didn't stop it from seeping into the church's entry way. When they had entered, the church's sublime order had been tainted by the acrid fragrance of nicotine.

The kids outside had cut through those clouds, paying no attention, and no one else had seemed to give it any thought. One of his wife's older brothers had corned him outside and talked about his family, his job, and his mother in quick succession before tersely asking, "How are you?" before being absorbed into settling an altercation between his children over a smartphone.

"Then no one will have it!" the brother boomed. His voice drained the defiance from the children, and the younger one handed over the device to his father. The older one turned to her father and said, "But what if something's corrupted?" she said.

"It's not corrupted!" objected the boy.

"You shouldn't be carrying around anything that important. I'm holding on to this until the funeral is over."

By the time the conflict defused itself, people began moving inside. The hearse had arrived, and a few members of the congregation materialized to transport his wife into the church for the service. He took this as a chance to escape inside. He wasn't asked to be a pall bearer, so it was the duty of that strange, strange to him, at least, collection of men in suits of many sizes to carry the plain, black lacquered coffin.

And so they moved through the ceremony. The priest read from the Book of Solomon:

>But the righteous, though they die early, will be at rest. For old age is not honored for length of time, or measured by number of years;  but understanding is gray hair for anyone, and a blameless life is ripe old age. 
 
>Being perfected in a short time, they fulfilled long years; for their souls 
were pleasing to the Lord, therefore he took them quickly from the midst of wickedness. 

Then she went on to describe his wife, and her time at the church, which had been short lived, and made even shorter by her untimely death. "But in saying untimely, what are we really saying? Are we seeking to find consolation in the fact that death was not deserved? Or do we provoke our strong feelings of sorrow and despair that something unjust and inexplicable happened. Solomon encourages us to look beyond our own notions of time. Our time and our experience here is not like building blocks, stacking one upon the other in an inevitable progression. Our 'understanding' and our embrace of a 'blameless life' can mark a detour, a break with what we were. Even in our youth, we can live with the wisdom and poise of someone beyond our actual age. And that's what Caroline was to us, those of us who knew her and welcomed her into our church."
