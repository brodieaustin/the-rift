The Rift
======

Chapter 1
---------

The low hanging clouds on that dreary November day kept the lumbering airship out of view. No one in the miles leading to the town of Briersville saw it coming. No one heard it either. The silent structure of cloth and steel had crept through the cloud cover. It must have descended gradually, foot after foot until it managed to collide with a newly built office building's radio tower.

The people in town hardly noticed it there, bobbing up and down, twisting side to side in the breeze. Then a brisk wind picked up, propelling the airship forward. The radio tower's metal struts whined. A woman on the sidewalk pushing a baby stroller looked up and screamed. People passing by stopped. A young couple rushed to her aid. A police car darted across the street and stopped, it's tires popping up over the curb.

The police officer, Office Doyle, jumped out and came to the woman's side. She seemed more interested in fleeing than in explaining what was happening. The young woman, dressed in a pressed white shirt and a green sweater kept saying, "Is your baby okay? Is she okay?"

Before the woman answered, though, they all looked up in unison, suddenly aware that the hulking mass of the airship was above them. It cancelled out everything in their immediate view. Stunned, even the woman didn't scream. No one moved, other people around them began to stop, wondering what could be so interseting to see. One by one, they looked up and saw the airship there. Soon the sidewalk was crowded with people. Cars were stopping in the road. A train that had left the station, stopped mid-track. As if sprouting from the windows, heads then whole torsos appeared in the windows along its length.

Officer Doyle was stunned as well. Usually one to spring into action, he rubbed the round of the hand across his forehead. He went to run his hand through his thinning hair—his usual response to stress and befuddlement —but pushed his hat off the back of his head and to the ground. The young man who had stopped earlier, bent to pick it up. 

"Here, Officer Doyle, here's your hat?"

"What's that?"

"Your hat, sit. It fell to the ground."

When the young man passed the rigid, structured hat back to Officer Doyle, the gesture or the hat reignited conscious thought in the officer. He looked around like someone waking up from a dream and realizing, to his horror, that he had sleep walked to the edge of a cliff. With the airship bobbing gleefully with each passing brush of wind, it was only a matter of time before it crash to the ground and exploded. Or exploded outright, he reminded himself.

"Okay, I need everyone to step back."

Much like the policeman, everyone else seemed too stunned or simply too curious to move. They didn't have the benefit of even the cursory training that Office Doyle received in Chicago. They hadn't imagined themselves gunning down thieves or engaging in high speed chases. Their imaginative reflexes simply weren't nearly as fine tuned as the policeman's. And the airship had overtaken his capacities with awe rather quickly.

"People, people. Move away. Cross the street. You..." He waved the young man who had picked up his hat, "Young man, come here. What's your name?"

"My name?" The young man shook his head, still trying to clear the strange image of the airship from his mind. "I'm Lonnie, sir." 

"Lonnie, you from around here?"

"No sir, I'm..."

The girl, whom he recognized, stepped forward, "He's my boyfriend. He's visiting."

Their bashfulness and hesitation seemed out of place in the current circumstances. Officer Doyle simply didn't register it, and merely proceeded on. "Good. Look, son, I need you to get out there and start getting those people in their cars to move. Got anything colorful?"

"I...I don't think so."

"Here," the policeman reached into his back pocket. "Take this kerchief. It's all I've got to spare right now. Clear a path. Keep the cars stopped, then we'll deal with them."

Lonnie looked down at the kerchief, then the road. Much like Office Doyle, the presence of these objects brought him back to consciousness. He dashed into the street and began waving the red kerchief.

"Everyone, I need you to cross the street," she shouted again.

The woman tipped her stroller down off the sidewalk and passed through the gap that Lonnie had managed to make with the help of the drivers. The girl, Lisa, began gently nudging people along too. Fortunately, once a few people started to move, the rest followed. They started circling the block, clearing the area.

It wasn't long afterwards that the fire department arrived. Three trucks in all. The other police squad cars appeared as well. Eveyone seemed to apepared at once. The men in uniforms jumped and dashed out of their vehicles. Then, one by one, they all came to a dead stop. Head after head tilted up, staring at the airship above them. Huddling happened next. Consultations. Gestures. 

The fire chief broke through the crowd on the other side of the street--he had walked from the station. The firefighters parted, letting him into the center of their group.

"Appeared out of nowhere..."

"It could blow any minute"

You could words like "Akron" and "Shendoah" rise from their ranks, those of them that remembered the fantastic crashes and explosions from that earlier era of aviation.

The police chief arrived with the mayor in tow, a woman as it turned out, and her assistant. The two chiefs and the mayor met and broke away, forming a separate group now to "talk this thing over"

"Is it stable? That's the main thing," the mayor asserted. "If it's not stable, we have a problem, don't we?"

"No way of knowing best I can tell," the fire chief explained.

"My man, Doyle, was first on the scene," the police chief said, apropos of nothing. The fire chief seemed irritated by the passing remark.

"We're ready to go up there, Mayor. It's your call," the police chief again.

The fire chief shifted his weight from side to side, looked back at his guys. He wasn't about to let the police chief upstage him here. He had lived in Briersville long before the police chief arrived on the scene. He knew people. And knowing people meant something.

The mayor interceded, "I don't want anyone going up there that isn't *experienced*," she said, managing to make both men irritated now. She had been a "professional" woman from the city not that long ago. She was more of an upstart than the police chief, as far as the fire chief was concerned. But they both accepted the logic of what she said. 

The fire chief rifled through the list of things he knew, of people that he knew. There had to be something or someone that could help out. Then he remembered something, the Plaice boy. He had been a war hero, or at least a veteran. The chief had to turn down his application to be a firefighter for...extenuating circumstance. But he had been a mountaineering solider, and lived in Colorado for some years.

"What about the Plaice boy..." he finally said, kicking at the sidewalk with the tip of his boot, and spitting off into the street.

"He's just a teenager!" the police chief objected.

"Not the young one. The older one."

"And why should we ask him," the mayor asked, leaning back on her left foot, ready for a round of verbal sparing. "Why should we ask a civilian to risk his life for this?"

"Well, he's a good boy. He'll do it."

"That's not what I asked," said the mayor.

"Sounds risky to me. Besides, we'd better clear it with the lawyer, " the police chief said.

"Bernie's on vacation."

"Can't we call him?" the mayor asked.

"Fly fishing..." That ended the discussion about that.

"So, what qualifies him for...whatever it is we're thinking about"

"He's a war veteran."

"I don't remember him from any of the parades or celebrations."

"No, he was too busy drinking and whoring in Colorado."

"I don't konw a thing about that."

"You aren't called out to the Keg every weekend."

The fire chief nodded at that. "True, true, but he wanted to a fire fighter..." He raised his hands to fend off objections. "And he fought in the mountains, in Italy during the war. He's a mountaineer. And did that in Colroado if memory serves."

"So, he can..."

"He can climb, madam Mayor. He can climb. He's got the gear and the skills."

"Well we can call the damn...excuse me Mayor...we can call the utility company out here to climb up there. They've got gear too."

"Sure, sure. But what would they do once they get up there?" They all turned to look up at the radio tower, scanning the heights of that gridwork of metal. It had seemed so stable and sturdy only a few hours ago, and now looked as delicate as a fine brocade of lace. You've got to gut up that tower, which seems to be hanging by a few bolts from the look of it, then you gotta grapple something onto the frame of that thing, shimmy up like some kind of monkey, get inside and have a look around. And who knows what's inside that thing!" The fire chief ended on a high note to punctuate his point. 

The mayor looked at the police chief. "Chief Nagel, do you have any objections?"

From the mayor's look and the police chief's sermon like discourse, the police chief knew that he was beat. He didn't have a better plan, and was secretely relieved that he didn't have to send one of his guys up there. Besides, the Plaices had always been a pain, so why not send a little something back their way. "No, madam, Mayor. I can't say that I do."

"Okay, then. Chief, please send one of your officers to retreive this Mr. Plaice."

"Nathaniel's his name, mayor."

"...to get Nathanial Plaice and inform him that his town kindly requests his help."

"And if he refuses?"

"I'm not sure exactly, chief. Be creative."

"Let's try to get these people home. I want downtown blocked off and baricaded. No one in here until we understand the situation better."

"Yes, mam," both men said, turning to their respective tasks.

Chapter 2
---------

Nathaniel Plaice wondered where his younger brother was. And his sister for that matter. No one was around, leaving him to finish chores around the house. The house always seemed to be in a state of disrepair. He might have caused some of it himself, but felt obligated to keep the appearance of things going. He learned quickly after moving back home that the appearances of things mattered in a way he didnt' understand anymore.

He resisted the urge to blame every strange or unsual on being at war. Hardly identified himself as a veteran, and couldn't much stand talk about units and regiments, fronts and advances. It sickened him all now. Fortunatly people around Briersville seemed to get over their war fever pretty quickly. Once the munitions factory closed down, that settled it for everyone.

A cold cup of coffee straddled the space between the countertop and the floor in the kitchen. He picked it up and immediately spit it out, finding his mouth full of wads of paper. Some queer thing his brother must be up to. Where was his brother? And his sister? 

The metalic whine of the screen door followed by a loud thwap sound announced the arrival of someone. His brother? No, two sets of feets. His sister. And her boyfriend, who was staying at the YMCA. "Nat! Nat! Are you here?"

"Yeah!" he shouted, roared really.

The two kids skidded into the kitchen. They look terrified and in awe, like someone who had just survived a bombardment, or ran through a field of machine gun fire untouched. 

"Did you hear?"

"Hear what?"

"About the airship. You didn't hear?"

The boyfriend chimed in, "This old airships, at least 50 years old..."

"Maybe 40", his sister corrected. 

"Maybe 40 years old got..."

"Snagged"

"Snagged on the radio tower in town."

"On top of the office building?"

"That's the one."

What were they going on about? He wondered. His sister, Lisa, was pacing the kitchen, full of more nervous energy than he had yet to see in her. She started in on her fingernails, biting and tearing at them. Her boyfriend, Lonnie, watched her. It was clear that his terror and awe all stemmed from her.

With his sister lost in thought about somethign, Nathaniel turned to the boyfriend, "Lonnie? Lonnie..." He snapped his fingers at him. "Tell me what's going on. I don't understand what you're talking about."

"Well, it's really peculiar."

"I get that..."

"I'm sorry. It just doesn't make sense. There's an airship, a rigid airship..."

"Dirigible..." Lisa inserted.

Lonnie was holding up one hand now, flat like a plane. "And the airship, up here, somehow came drifting down and..." Another hand represented the office building. "Then like that it get's snagged on the radio tower. And it doesn't blow up."

"It hasn't blown up?" Nathaniel asked.

"Not yet," Lisa replied, stepping into their conversation now. "But it could at any minute right? It's just a big gas cloud covered in metal. And even it doesn't blow up. What it just deflates and just, kind of, drapes itself over the town..."

"Like a blanket!" said Lonnie, though neither Plaice felt the figure quite captured it.

"But, Nathaniel, the realy puzzle is, where did this thing come from. I mean, an airhsip?"

"No one has really built a airship for twenty or thirty years," he said.

"Exactly. Has it just been floating up there in the sky for all this time, just waiting to come down."

"And why here, exactly?" asked Lonnie. Being the outsider, he didn't take it as a given that an enormous airship would appear anywhere else but Briersville. But he coudl readily imagine his own home town faced with the same circumstances. For all they knew every small town in America was facing the same crisis.

"Well," Nathaniel finally said, "It's not our problem, and you're safe, so let's move on, okay?" As if responding to him, they all turned at the distant sound of police sirens, sirens that came closer and closer to their house. The driver must have killed the sound at their entrance to long driveway that led off of the county road to the farmhouse where they lived. 

A knock on the door. Nathaniel went to answer with Lisa and Lonnie trailing behind him. It was Office Doyle again. "Officer Doyle, how can I help you?"

The police officer hardly acknowledged the two kids who had helped him out with the crowd earlier. "Afternoon. Probably heard about the airship in town."

"I did. My sister just came from there and told me about it. You making sure everyone hears about. Any roads closed."

"Oh sure. Downtown is barricaded for now. Not much going in and out."

"Hope that won't impact the businesses down there too much."

"Yeah, we'll see."

Officer Doyle seemed to forget the purpose of his visit. Behind him, the can shaped lights on his far rotated furiosuly, even though the sun and sky absorbed most of their light.

"But that's not the real reason I'm calling on you, Nathaniel."

As he removed his hat, Nathaniel realized that he needed to invite the officer in. "Why don't you come inside then."

"Don't mind if I do."

"Need anythign to drink, Officer Doyle?" Lisa asked.

"No thank young lady. Oh, you were outside the office building earlier."

"Yes, sir"

"Big help these two, right in the middle of the action." Nathaniel reaised an eyebrow at his sister, who deflected his inquisitive, irritated gesture, as she so often did.

"Let's sit down here in the parlor and talk over...what ever it is you came out here to talk about."

Officer Doyle turned his hat around and around in his hands. He sat on the edge of the long couch in the front parlor, his feet pitched far apart. He leaned forward with his elbows propped on his knees. "This is kind of a sensitive matter. And, I think speaking for everyone in town..." Nathaniel understood him to mean the mayor and the two chiefs, "...that it would be best to not go telling everyone what we talk about here."

Nathaniel nodded his head, not really to indicate that he understood anything, but just the fill the space between his confusion and his reluctance to hear whatever the police officer had to tell him.

"You see we have a...information problem on our hands."

"You might have more than that," Nathaniel replied.

"Yes, exactly. But, we don't know. We don't properly know." The police officer spoke with a far away, almost dreamy quality in his voice. Between his sister and her boyfriend, Nathaniel found fragments of an old poem floating back into his memory:

    'There was a ship,' quoth he.
    'Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!'
    Eftsoons his hand dropt he.

    He holds him with his glittering eye—

Apparently these lines had been in his memory for years, though he hadn't recalled them before today. 

"And how can you help with your information problem, Office Doyle?"

"My superiors," whom Nathaniel knew to be the two chiefs and the mayor, "think you have a special skill that can be or services."

"Tending a rundown farm? Picking up after adolescent siblings? Or, maybe, being harrassed by the police for having a few drinks?"

"Well as to that last one you know we have certain rules on the books that have to be followed."

"Fine. But it sounds like you are going to ask me to do something that isn't a run of the mill request. So, I would apprecitate the courtesy of you just coming out to say it to me."

The office straightened himself out a bit, either uncomfortable or annoyed, Nathaniel couldn't say. "Yes, well, that skill involves your time in the army."

"Oh, so slogging through muddy fields, huddling in frozen mountain caves?"

"That last one. No, I mean your mountaineering skills. That's what we're talking about."

Nathaniel leaned back in his chair. "I see. And how exactly will those skills be useful to you?"

"Imagine this. Imagine a seesaw." Officer Doyle help one hand flat and upright in the air. He placed the other flat across it. "And that seesaw is rocking back and forth. This plank is just balanced on a pin point, nothing at all. Only that plank is metal and fabric and maybe filled with dangerous gas. But we don't know, and there's not many people who can climb up that pin point, which is really a 30 foot tall pin point that isn't safely secured anymore."

"That's what you're asking me to do, to climb up to this airship and see when and if it will explode over our town?"

"Yes, that's exactly it."

"And what if I refuse?"

"My boss' instructions were to be *creative*."

Chapter 3
---------

"Who the hell is there?" The surly voice shot down from a platform high up in the trees above.

"It's me you asshole," replied Arthur.

"Got the smokes?"

"Yeah, I got 'em"

"Then come the hell on up"

A rope dropped and dangled unceremoniously in front of Arthur's face. He hated climbing up the rope ladder like some kind of army recruit. But he had to deliver the package to Jeff, Charlie, and the other guys.

When he finally scrambled up on to the plaform and stood up, three other guys hunched around him. One of them, Charlie, was stabbing the wood under his feet with a switchblade, then carving dirty words into it. The other two--Jeff and Nick--were laughing and saying "boobs" over and over again.

"You got it?" Charlie looked up from his woodworking.

"Yep," said Arthur. He took off a stiff green army knapsack. flipped it open, and took out a bundle wrapped in a red bandana. He untied the bandanna and took out two packages of cigarettes.

"Hey that one's open already!" complained Jeff, who was the tallest of the three.

"So!" said Arthur. He started to put the bundle back in his pack.

"Give it over, Paisley", their creative transformation of his last name. "That's not yours to give and take as you want. You owe us."

"It's a tithe," said Nick, who secretly was the smart one, probably as smart as Arthur, maybe as smart as his sister.

"A what?" said the other two.

"Nevermind, here. I could only lay my hands on these two. They're fresh though."

"We'll be the judge of that," said Charlie. He retrieved a banged up metal lighter--one that he claimed his father used in the war, and lit up one the cigarrettes. He inhaled and exhaled, brushing off little bits of tobacco left behind on his lips. "Pretty good." He passed the the pack around. The two other boys didn't turn pass on them, open or not.

The pack came back around to Arthur. His slender fingers dug into the pack for a smoke, flimsy now that three had already been taken out. The cigerattes rolled back and forth under his fingers.

"Here." Charlie grabbed the pack, shook it until the cigarattes all clumped together at the opening, then gave it a quick upwards flick. Like drawing straws, Arthur pulled one out and lit up with the other boys. They all stood silently, taking short drags from cigerattes. Not having to pass it from mouth to mouth felt like a luxury, though Arthur hoped that his brother never found out that he was stealing cigarettes.

In their minds, they posed and modeled as someone they knew or had seen in a movie. Each boy sucked in his cheeks, made his eyes narrow and grim. 

"Oh, shit!" Nick said, stamping out his cigarette and making for the rope ladder.

"What is it?" Arhtur asked. Then he heard the whine of police sirens. 

"We gotta get out of here!"

"Relax," said Charlie. "They ain't coming this way."

"How do you know?" Arthur asked.

"Because it's already getting fainter."

"Wonder where it's goin'," said Jeff.

"Who cares," said Charlie.

"There's another one," Arthur said.

"Whoa, we gotta find out what's going on."

"Why!?" said Charlie, clearly upset that *his* group was hatching plans without him.

"Could be major, like an earthquake or something," said Jeff. Noone bothered to point out the obvious problems with his theory. One by one, they slid down the rope to the ground.

They assembled around Charlie's black, banged up car. He sauntered up slowly, as if reminding them that they travelled by virute of grace. He was a few years older and having a car made him a very powerful, and persuasive, figure in the group. Once in the car, Charlie passed the cigarettes around again. Arthur knew that he'd have to figure out a way to get the smoke smell off his clothes at home. The vial of perfume he had lifted from this sister's room had caused more problems than it solved for him.

Much as they had on the wooden platform in the woods, each boy sat mostly silent, smoking, staring out at the farmlands around Briersville. They were only a few miles away from the center of the town, but the landscape and worlds between here and there could not have been more different. They didn't have to travel long, though, before they each saw a enormous thing hovering over their town.

"It's goddamn aliens!" should Jeff, pitching himself onto to dash board to get a better look. 

"What would aliens be doing in Briersville? Think wontcha!" replied Charlie.

"Okay then what is it?" Jeff replied.

"It's an airship," said Arthur.

"An old airship," added Nick.

"See," Charlie said, thumping Jeff's arm hard with his first. "Not aliens."

"But aliens could be driving it."

"Pilot it," corrected Nick.

"Since when was everyone a bunch of pointy headed professors around here."

"Didn't ever see newsweels of the Hindenberg or the Graf Zeppelin?" Nick asked.

"No!"

"Just because we know what it is, doesn't make it make sense," Arthur asserted. "I don't think airships really fly anymore."

"There's that blimp over football games sometimes," Charlie said.

"Sure, but that's just a big balloon. An airhip is...a lot more complicated," Arthur said.

"And why is it here? There hasn't been any planes made around here in years," Nick said. He stopped himself short. No one said anything, and avoided looking at Arthur. He tried to shrug off the awkwardness as best as he could. It wasn't even worth going through the feelings anymore. Showing his discomfort would make him weak. Arthur had resolved never to be weak, especially around these guys.

Finally, Charlie said, "Well, boys, let's go check it out." He gunned the car and it shot forward down the long strip of road before them.

When they reached the center of the town, a police officer waved them off to the right. They caught his glare as soon as he recognized who was in the car. Charlie flicked a cigarette butt at the offier's feet. Everyone in the car smirked and laugh. Getting one up on the local cops was an on going matter of their discussions and plans. More ofen than not their best plans failed on some crucial detail.

The fact that Jeff's father was a fire fighter didn't endear their little group to the police either. Each officer on the force seemed to take particular satisfaction in dragging the deliquent son to the father's front steps.

"Sealed off pretty tight," Nick said.

"They don't want anyone coming in," Arthur agreed.

"There aren't enough cops in town to close every road. We can get in." Charlie pulled hard to the left and parked on a residential street just out of site of the patrol car blocking the road. They got out and started walking towards the building.

They could see the backside of the airship much more clearly. Arthur studied it intently, almost fell over twice because of it. It did look old. He could see scraps of fabric coming loose from the frame. As he stared up at the huge airship, Arthur automatically followed the boys, who were creeping alongside a building, then turning into an alley.

The alleys weren't being monitored and they crossed several blocks before needing to retreat out of sight again. Arthur had never seen the town so quiet and still before. He almost imagined himself being the last person on Earth, only he had three people with him. 

After creeping and stalking their way through town, they finally arrived at the backside of the office building. Charlie walked up to the rear delivery door and gave it a rough pull. The door swung open, and made Charlie stumble back a few steps before regaining his footing. "Gentlemen," he said, waving the boys inside the building.

Chapter 4
---------

Somehow her brother had convinced Officer Doyle that he wasn't fit for the job. The argument hinged on his lack of equipment. "I didn't keep and thing. And no one in town would have what I need."

"Well, let's talk to the chief. I'm sure we can work something out."

Lisa could tell that Office Doyle didn't want to cause a scene, and probably wasn't being as "creative" as he could have been. She wished he would. She felt irritated that her brother wouldn't just relent and agree to do it. He would be a hero, after all. She still felt, event being older and understanding a bit more about these things, that he had been cheated out of a hero's welcome so long ago.

She had just been a little girl, certainly she felt that now, and couldn't accept that her big brother, whom everyone had been worrying so much about, wasn't coming home. She kept claiming that he had died, but her parents would quickly correct her in the grocery store aisle or the waiting for an open bank teller. "He's just staying out in Colorado for awhile." At that point whatever stranger--stranger to her at least--that they were talking to would politely find some way to end the conversation. 

After the policeman left, she stormed into the front parlor, where her brother stood watching squad car disappear in a cloud of dust. "What was that about?"

"What exactly?"

"That!" she pointed out the window.

"That was a police officer."

"I know that, Nathaniel. You don't have to be smart with me." She realized that she was speaking to him like a parent.

"Lisa, I don't know what you could mean."

"Not volunteering to help."

"Help do what exactly?"

"Go up and invetigate that airship."

"And why should I?"

"It's the right thing to do."

"According to who?"

"Well..." she realized that she had to think this one through. Her brother was always pining her only little barbs of logic. "According to me, for one thing."

"It may be hard to understand this, but doing the "right thing"  just because it is gratifying doesn't make it the right thing all the time. Besides, that airship is probably filled with helium. It won't expldoe."

"Bit it stil could crash and drap a lot of metal and skin all over everything."

"Yes, that's true. But not the end of the world. It's probably worse that they've got everything shut down, down there."

"Well, there could be people down there."

"He didn't mention anyone calling for help. I mean, if you were stuck in an old airship that just collided with a building, wouldn't you call for help?"

Lisa hadn't really considered that point before. As usual, her brother made a strong case. It woudl be difficult to manuever around that one. But they could be hurt and needing help."

"Or, dead already. Had you considered that?"

"Are you saying it's a ghost ship?"

"Sure, why not. And I try not to go chasing after ghosts, if I can avoid it. I spent enough time doing that already."

Of course he meant, "in the war". Whenever he invoked "enough time doing x" it meant the war and was a cue to drop the topic of conversation. Lisa was much more clued into the is than her younger brother. Unlike her, Arthur wouldn't observe the signs, even if he noticed them at all.

Lisa stomped off through the house, grabbing Lonnie's hand as she didn. "Where are we going?"

"To the shed," she said.

The "shed" really was an old barn behind the house. It wasn't full of animals and hay, though. It hadn't for as long as Lisa could remember. She forced open the rusty door enough to squeeze through and climbed up into the loft. In one corner were boxes her brother had sent before his move home. The boxes had never been opened. A few years of dust already covered them, which made them less dusty than the other bins, barrels, and boxes in the shed.

She opened the boxes, pulling out books and old clothes. "Lisa, what are we looking for?" Lonnie asked. "It's really dust...ahchoo...in here."

"Here it is." Lisa pulled out large coils of rope, pitons, and other climbing gear. "Here, help me get this stuff into the house."

"What is all of this?"

"Climbing equipment. My brother used to climb mountains."

They piled up everything on the kitchen table. Nathaniel came in, shook his head, and turned around, raising his voice as he did, "I expect that to be put away, Lisa."

Instead of packing everything away, Lisa and Lonnie arranged all of the gear on the table. They gathered today the robes, the climbing aids. Put the worn boots with an equally worn pair of gloves. "There's a lot of stuff here," Lonnie commented. Lisa nodded her head.

She decided that leaving the equipment on te table might persuade her brother to take it up and go help out at the site of the airship. In the meantime, she wondered what was going on with back in town. The radio in the parlor wasn't working--hadn't worked for a few years now, so they went out to Lonnie's car to listen.

"...Local authorities advise residents to stay away from the center of town. The airship could be unstable. Officials from the FAA were not able to comments on the situation, not having been advised of any lighter than air craft that might be in the vicinity. Locally, air traffice controllers in the region are puzzled as well. Based on the airship current position and heading, no airports in a 10 mile radius of is flight path detected any abnormal activity."

"It's weird, isn't it?" Lisa said, talking over the steady cadence of the radio announcer.

"The airship, definitely."

"Not just the airship, but the idea of it too. It's weird to think about where it came from. Why it's here."

"Must have blown off course or something."

"Maybe but you heard what they just said. No one noticed a thing. Dont you think someone would have picked it up on radar or something?"

"Well, that's just what they're saying... It's some kind of cover up?"

"Not exactly. I don't know. But it came from somewhere, right? What if there are more?"

"More airships drifting long with seemingly no one piloting it? Seems unlikey, doesn't it?"

"I guess, but just imagine that there are hundreds of lost planes and airships and other things just floating along up there, waiting to be sent back down to earth."

"But everyone inside would be dead!"

"Maybe, but how else do you explain the airship that just crashed in the middle fo our town. It had to have been floating around for years. And something made it finally come down."

It's too bad your brother doens't want to go up and check it out. Sounds pretty exicting."

"He'll come aroudn. It's just a matter of time."

Once the news switch to some other story, national politics, legistlators disagreeing with each other, they switched the radio over to a rock and roll station. Instead of agitating them into a teenage frenzy of movement though, the comforting, familiar sounds lulled them both there in the car. They each closed their eyes and nodded off, siting in the front seat of the car.

Lisa work up first, startled awake by a signal test on the radio. She nudged Lonnie who woke up to. "Fell asleep? Uh, I feel terrible. Guess we should go back inside."

Soups smells filled the house--onions and celelry sauteeing, tomotaoes simmering. Nathaniel was hovering over a tall battered soup pot in the kitchen. Lisa always felt like he looked most like an old soldier when he cooked. There was something grim and quick about his movements. He cooked for them most of the time, but always dead simple things that required one or two pots most.

"Time to eat?" Lonnie asked cheerfully. Nathaniel glared at him.

Lisa stepped in, "Let's set the table. Then we'll take you back to the Y."

"Lonnie, when are you going home?" Nathaniel asked. Lisa cringed at how rude her brother was being. It wasn't Lonnie's fault that he was caught in their squabble.

"His mom and bad are coming back from Europe on WEdnesday."

"They don't even know he's here?"

"Well, not exactly," Lisa said.

"They know I'm not home. But they don't know where exactly."

"Oh great. Well, it's none of my business. Just don't get me involved in any trouble that might happen. I'm washing my hands of it."

"Figures," Lisa interjected.

Nathaniel tasted the soup slowly and calmly. Not looking at her, he said, "I would advise you to get the hell out of this house right now."

"Come on Lonnie, we'll go into town for supper."

Lonnie whipsered to her, "I don't have any money to cover it."

"Don't worry, I'll pay for it. Let's just get out of here."

Chapter 5
---------

They sat up on the rooftop bullshitting, smoking, spitting, under the shadow of the airship. Arthur nervously glanced at the radio tower's creeking base, but tried to downplay his anxiety. The other guys didn't seem to notice just how perilous their current situation was. So, just like he usually didn, Arthur imagined himself slipping a mask. It wasn't a monster's mask, with mishapen ears and perfectly round holes bored into the eye sockets. It was a perfectly fitting mask that he seemed to wear in a very comfortable way. But just like those cheap drug store masks, this mask made all those everday worries and concerns a little harder to see and hear.

Once the sun went down completely, the temperature droped twenty degrees. The wind picked up again. The airship creaked in a rhyhmic way above them. "I'm cold," Jeff complained. None of them had heavy coats or sweaters on.

"I've got something for that," Charlie said. He produced a scratched up metal flask from his jacket. 

"Pass it around!" said Jeff excitedly. Charlie only brought out the flask on special occasions.

They each took turns downing sips of brandy from the flask. It wasn't good quality, not like what Arthur's father used to drink. He remembered his father letting him try a sip at a holiday dinner when he was little. He had wrinkled his nose and everyone at the table laughed in a good humored way as the little boy said, "Yuckee daddy!" He shivered. Must be the taste of the brandy and the cold, he thought. But the shivering stopped once the brandy started to make him feel loose and warm.

Charlie was the most animated. He was circling the base of the radio tower, pushing it at random, hoisting himself on it then propelling himself back on the roof. Only a foot or two at a time. Around and around. Suddenly he stopped and turned to the group, huddled together, warming their hands over a lighter. "I have an idea," he said.

"What's that?" Nick asked, probably trying to get out in front of whatever crazy idea their "leader" was sure to have.

"Well, no one knows why this thing is here, right?"

What makes you say that," Nick asked.

"No one's up here. No cops, no investigators. No scientists runnig around with geiger counters or anything. So no one knows what hte make of it."

"Dumb ashes," Jeff said in a slur.

"Let's help them out."

"How'll we do that?" Arthur asked.

"Glad you asked Paisly. 'Caus you're going to go up there." Charlie was pointing up at the airship. The twenty or thirty feet between them and the underside of the airship seemed much greater in light of this "idea."

"Me?"

"Sure, of course you."

"Why, of course?"

"Well, you're still the new guy. You haven't passed all of the tests. And this is the mother of all tests."

Arthur looked wildly at the two other boys. They seemed calm and removed, as if to reinforce the idea that he had not been tested. Arthur wondered whther any of them really had had to climb up an unstable radio tower to climb into a ancient airship that had mysteriously appeared out of thin air. But no one would say anything now. They didn't want to accompany him up there.

"And you're brother was some kind of mountain climber or something, right?"

"Yeah, but it's not like he taught me anything."

"Well, you know more than Nick or Jeff here, besides Jeff is sloshed and Nick is an egghead. He can barely do a pull up in gym." Nick nodded solemnly. Jeff was rolling side to side on his back, saying, "It's a long way up there, Paisly."

"What if I say no?"

"Terrible things will happen I'm sure."

"Sure would be cold to be stuck up here all night," said Jeff.

Arthur stared at Nick, whom he could count on from time to time to assert some reason into assignements like this. But Nick wouldn't budge. "Come on, Nick, this is crazy. That thing's not safe."

"Nick is, I'm sure, very intellectually curious about what's inside that sirhip."

"Then why don't you send him up there."

Charlie in all of this two year older bulk stepped to Arthur, towered over him, and said, "Because I didn't tell him to. I told you. Now get up there." He shoved the flask in his hand. "Screw up your courage."

There was one swig in the flask left, brandy diluted with their collective spit. Arthur downed it, not even noticing the taste. There were no arguments to be made, no one to back him up. He could bolt for the door. He even tried to shift in that direction, before realizing that Charlie had been slowly backing him against the radio tower without him even noticing.

The only option, it seemed was to climb.

Arthur huffed some hot breaths into his hands to loosen up his cold fingers. He bounced around a few times, shook his head. "Come on Paisly, climb!" Jeff said.

"Get on with it, Paisly. Come back with a full report."

Arthur grapsed the radio tower with both hands and gave it a shake. It actually seemed more secure that he had expected. He got himself up on the first rows of the tower's lattice work. The effects of the brandy made him feel more comfortable than he had epected. He kept going and got a few feet off the ground pretty quickly.

He turned to look back and realized that he had come pretty far. The wind felt more severe even a little bit higher up. He also could feel the tower swaying more that it did higher up. He got higher up, and could hear the guys below whooping and hollering, even though they seemd to not be paying attention to him at all.

Arthur had just a few more feet to cover before he reached the airhip. From up here, he got a better view of the tangle of fabric and metal girders wheren it was colided with the radio tower. He figured he could just grabbed one of the girders and hoist himself up. The structure probably would be rigid enough to support his weight. What he would do once inside remained to be seen.

His hands were getting cold and numb now, though. The brandy wasn't working. The exertion of climbing probably had burned it all up. One by one he huffed again into his hands to warm them. He tried to pull at a little extra length of his shirt to use as golves, but his hand immediately slipped from the tower wrapped in fabric. Not worth the risk at this point.

The tower creaked under his weight not that he was at the narrowest part of it. He could feel it shifting downwards. He would have to move fast. The opening into the airship wasn't as large as he had thought now that he was touch it.

He shimmied up closer to the top. The airship kept bobbing just out of reach. Finally he grabbed a scrap of the outer fabric that hung down. He gave it a yank, but as he did, the tower lurched dangerously down. 

Arthur kept his grip on the fabric, but he hadn't made the opening any larger. He remembered that he had a small pocketknife in his pocket. He gripped the airship tighter than before, clenched his legs to the point of straining around the tower's framework and retrieved this knife. He wished that he had Charlie's switch blade, instead of the single blade knife that needed two hand to open. He settled on using his teeth and his free hand to open it.A few tries and he managed to extract the blade and lock it in place. 

The wind was noisy in his ears. Even still the ripping sounds of the fabric sounded louder than he expected. The fabric also was much tougher than expected. To have any effect at all, he had to saw at the tear in the fabric, tug at it forcefully then saw some more.

Even though he was exhausted, Arthur felt a surge of strength and confidence when he realized that the opening was large enough now to climb up. The torn strip of fabric was also long enough for him to climb up like a ragged piece of rope. He could shimmy up and grab the girders and be inside.

As he planned his final ascent, though, he also noticed the the din that the guys below were causing. Would anyone hear them, he wondered. He really didn't want to be hauled home for this.

Arthur took a deep breath and grabbed the fabric with both hands. He let one foot go free then another. The fabric began to rip, leaving him dangling hundreds of feet above the street. The tearing stop though, and he worked his way up bit by bit. He could reach the metal frame now and swung a leg up to get inside.

Just then, he could hear shouting below, and just make out, "What's going on up there!?" He heard a loud, "Oh shit" then feet scrambling on the roof top. The roof door slammed. Arthur realized that he was all alone now, hovering above town, in an ancient airship.

Chapter 6
---------

Lisa forgot that Earl's diner was closed because it sat right near the office building with an airship pinned to it. They got as far as the police barricade before a police officer waved them off. They turned around and drove to the Moonlight, which was a little more rundown and a little more greasy than Earl's. But they were both hungry and the Moonlight had decent milkshakes.

Figthing with her older brother had made her completley forget about her younger brother. She said outloud as they pulled in front of the diner. "I wonder where Arthur is right now?"

"Probably up to no good," said Lonnie, forgetting, as he seemed to do, that this was a sensitive subject with her. 

Her glare at him bore a striking resemblance to her brother's glare and she said, "I'm sure he's fine. Let's eat."

Their waitress turned out to be the mother of one of Arthur's new "friends." Ms. Halloway was a lady with reputation, which generally meant bad things in Briersville. She was a smoking and drinking kind of woman, but in a rougher way that the other smoking and drinking ladies in town didn't approve of.

She obviously had just come in from a smoke break because she was coughing as she walked up to them.

"Know what you want yet?"

Lisa looked over the menu. "I'd like a breakfast."

"Just eggs, hashbrowns and toast now. Nothing else."

"Okay, I'll have that."

"What's your soup?" Lonnie asked.

"Vegetable soup."

"Is it good?"

"It's soup."

"Hmmm... I just can't decide. Should I get the soup?" He seemed genuinely concerned about the soup. "Okay, I'll get the soup. And an order of french fries."

"Fryer's broken."

"Hashbrowns then."

"Fine." She scribbled a few things before being called to another table with a brusque, "Lorraine!"

When their food arrived, Lisa decided to ask Ms. Halloway about Arthur. Maybe she saw them. "Ms. Halloway, I'm Lisa Plaice. Have you seen my brother around?"

"Why would I have seen your brother?"

"I don't know. He's been hanging aroudn with your son, Charlie."

"And why would I have seen him. I'm here all day and night it seems. It's not my job to keep tabs on your brother for you, young lady."

"I'm sorry, I just thought maybe they had come by."

"Come by here? I'm glad they didn't." Another customer was waving her away again. "Just eat your food and stop asking questions about my son."

"Yes, mam," was Lisa's meek reply, even though she was roiling with anger inside.

Lonnie was slurping at his soup, "How's your food?"

Lisa was picking at her eggs and hashbrowns staring out of the window when a police car pulled up in front of the diner. The flashing lights lit up the counters and booth with red and blue. An old woman covered eyes, complainging about the bright lights. The lights obscured who was in the car. An officer steped out, then a door slammed. The diner door jingled and Ms. Halloway's son Charlie was pushed through the open door by the police officer.

"Is Lorraine around?" the officer asked the other waitress. Ms. Halloway came out of the kitchen, grabed an order that was ready, and walked past the officer and her son.

"What'd he do now?"

"Well, mam, might be something to discuss in private," said the officer, scanning the room and all of the eyes that were trained at him. Having an audience like this made the young man uncomfortable. Charlie stood with head down. More because he seemed tired than out of a sense of shame.

Ms. Halloway passed back by, saying brusquely, "Officer, I don't have time for this. You," she pointed at her son, "take a seat there. My shift is over in an hour." Her son slunk down in the last booth of the diner, kept his head down and didn't look at anyone. 

Lisa got up and started walking towards him. "Lisa, where are you going?" Lonnie asked.

"I'll be back," she said. She walked up to Charlie, who didn't bother to look up at her. He was pouring salt and pepper into piles on the table.

"What d'you want?" he asked.

"Where's my brother?"

"How should I know?"

"It's not an unreasonable question."

"Buzz off."

Lisa returned to her booth. Lonnie had finished his soup. "How did it go?"

"Not well."

"Lisa?"

"Yes, Lonnie?"

"I've been thinking..."

"Not now..." Lisa's attention shifted to the row of police cars that had pulled up and the police chief who was coming in to the dinner now. He sat at the counter top. When he caught Charlie's mom's eye he said, "Ms. Halloway, we need to have a word."

"I'm busy chief."

"No worries about that. I called up Sal and he said you could have a nice long break. So why don't you pour a cup of coffee for me in a to-go cup and let's step outside."

Lorainne poured hte coffee and tossed her apron on the counter in defeat, stepping outside with the police chief.

Lisa leaned forward and whispered, "Lonnie, I have to go to the lady's room."

He leaned forward and asked, "Why are you whispering?"

She got up anyway, walked to the other side of the diner, passing Charlie as she did. They locked eyes, like hunter and prey, as she crossed him. She stepped into the lady's room. The window was just large enough to slip through. She scooted the garbage can over and hoisted herselt up. She swung her leg up on to the metal window frame, then rolled to the side and out the window. Hanging on the other side of the window, she let herself drop to the ground.

Lisa felt like a sleuthign detective or a spy, creeping close the diner's outer wall. She deparately wanted to hear what the chief was saying to Charlie's mom. Her gut told her that something was a going on, but she didn't quite enough pieces for her imagination to figure out what.

At the corner, she slunk down with her back aginst the wall and listened. She could hear the chief say, "I'm only going to say it again. If your boy crosses our barricades again, he's going to be put in jail. I'm dead serious about this Lorraine."

"Then why don't you take him now?"

"Because he's a kid and I knew your father. Boys will be boys and all that but you have to admit this crosses the line."

"I still don't understand what you're so upset about," Charlie's mother said.

"Lorraine, wake up! Your son is turning into a deliquent. He and those other boys were on top of that building drinking and smoking and doing whatever else. It's enough that they were trespassing on private property, but given the current situation, they were putting their lives and other people's lives at risk. What if they had caught that airship on fire. What then?"

Lisa could only hear silence. Apparently Charlie's mother had so hardened herself against caring about her son's failings, that even this warning did little to move her. Lisa tried to piece together what exactly had been going on. Arthur's "friends" were caught hanging out on top of hte building with the airship. She wondered if Arthur had been up there too?

When she heard the door jangle again, she quickly turned the corner and pretended to be calmly walking along to go into the diner. "Chief Carruthers! Chief Carruthers!"

The police chief turned. "Lisa Plaice. What can I do for you?"

"Chief, I was just wondering if you've seen my brother."

"Arhtur? No, not tonight. I've got to run, some other places to be tonight." He got back in the passenger seat of the last remaining squad car and drove away. 

Lisa assumed that he had other calls like this one to make. But it was strange that he hadn't seen Arthur. Would he have told her if her brother was in trouble? He had talked to her before about trying to keep him inline, to make sure that he came in contact with the "right influences." Once he put that burden on her, wouldn't he have volunteered information about Arthur to her?

As she tried to go back into the diner, Charlie ran into her as he was bolting out of the diner. "Get out of my way," he said and started to jog down the street.

Lisa turned to chase him. She ran track in school and quickly overtook him. She grabbed at the loose folds of his jacket and yanked him back. Surprised by her strenth, he stopped. He whipped around, fist raised and ready to hit her, but he yanked his other arm free. "What do you want?"

"I want to know where my brother is."

"I got nothing to say. Will you leave me alone."

"I bet you were up on that roof with him. And I want to be sure he's okay."

"Oh, he's okay, just a little light on his feet right now." He bolted away from her. She decided not to chase after him again.

She walked back to the diner and found Lonnie waiting for her, leaning against the car. "Lisa," he said as she walked up to him. "I think I better go. And maybe...maybe we shouldn't see each other for a while."

"What do you mean, Lonnie?"

"I don't know. Things seem...pretty complicated around here. You're fighting with your brother. You're climbing out of bathroom windows and chasing after guys like that."

"I'm just worried about my brother, Lonnie."

"I get that. I really do. But it doesn't have anything to do with me. So, I think I better go."

"Fine, Lonnie. Can you at least drop me off at home."

"I don't think that's such a good idea."

"How the hell am I supposed to get home then?"

"I don't know. I bet someone will give you a ride."

"You want me to hitch back home?"

"I'm not saying that. There seems be a lot of police officers in and out of that diner. I bet one of them will take you home."

"If that's the way you feel, then I think you'd better go." She turned away from him, not wanting to let him see her crying. She didn't really know why she was crying, but she was.

"Are you crying?"

"Just leave Lonnie. I'm not crying. Not crying for you anyways. And what business is it of your's anyway."

"I don't want to be upset."

"Lonnie, I think my brother's in trouble and you're the last person I want to tell about it right now."

She went back inside to the diner and sat at the empty booth. The plates had not been cleared away yet. It seemed like Charlie's mother was causing some kind of disturbance in the back. The unpaid check still sat on the tablet too. Lonnie hadn't been kidding when he said that he couldn't cover the cost of dinner wherever they went.

She pulled out the slim wallet that she kept in her jacket pocket got money to pay for dinner. She decided to leave a little extra tip for Ms. Halloway. She wasn't sure if this was a kidn gesture or a condescending one. Regardless, Charlie's mom might ot even register the difference. What mattered, Lisa decided, was how she felt about the gesture. She decided it was done out of kindness and was a way of saying, "It'll be okay. And this token is a little bit of proof that I have to show it."

Chapter 7
---------

A few whiskeys later and Nathaniel was thinking about the past. The kitchen wasn't perfectly cleaned up. The pot of soup had been cooling for some time now, but Nathaniel was too immersed in his thoughts of days in the past to get up and bother with it. 

Their father's death had been sudden, particularly for him, since he tried not to stay in too close contact with him. It suited Nathaniel just fine being a recluse from his fmaily--from eeryone--in Colorado. When he worked in the mountains, no one expected him to say much of anything that suited him well.

IT was hard now, though, to remember why exactly he went to Colorado. Certainly it was a relief that he wouldn't have to march in any parades or accept any resouwrds for bravery or valor or whatever.

As he cycled throuhg old thing in his mind, he kept coming back to feeling that he had on the day of his father's funeral. He had just flown in on a small plane from a small regional airport. He had taken buses and trains and airplanes to get there. Yet despite having travelled for two days and hardly had anything to eat, he could help feeling that his legs hadn't been built for pews. The rise and fall of the seats always seemed too dramatic. The angle of the back too severe. And his legs\-\-too short by far, not optimized for the kneeling, not suited for the sitting. He had carried this physical discomfort in religious seating for a long time, since at least a time when he was younger and his mother had passed through a phase of religious interest.

The strange thing was that his father hadn't been a religious man. Nathaniel hadn't remembered him being that way, at least. He always seemed like a man of the world, very concerned with things in the here and now. But his father's will had stipulated that he was to have a funeral ceremony in the town's Episcopal church.

So, Nathaniel had calmly agreed to the setting, to the tone of the service. It was simply a matter of following the letter of the law, the intentions set forth in the will. Intentions he had nodded over at some time. At the service those intentions were made real, his father's spirit embodied itself in those plans.

He remembered how everyone around him seemed perfectly settled into their places. Distant relatives from his father's side came from miles away to pay their respects. They all seemed to know their roles, or to pick up perfectly news ones, with little prompting. Everyone sat and stood at the right times. Hymnals opened, pages flipped. Voices raised together. And he could hardly sit still through any of it.

The rebellion his body put up wasn't done as a conscious rebellion. He wasn't the sulking teenager that his father had always taken him for. Those feelings had long since been replaced by other ones. The war had seen to that. Now he could launch into action with little thought as to why. S,o, even though he had learned a good deal many "life lessons" and could be called a man with little quibbling over the term, he couldn't help but feel there was some other intention at work here that made the seats and the temperature in the room and the other people made him uncomfortable.

The only distraction he found was tracing out the patterns in the old worn parquet flooring. The scuffs and scraps didn't quite have the poetry of the old pews in Europe, worn by centuries of common people lumbering back and forth between work and church. But he was intent on following the orderly zigzag of the floor, then trace out the chaotic spirals and chopped up lines made countless numbers of heels over the years. He puzzled over the wear and tear, wondering if it was a sign of piety, of boredom, or revolt. Had people shuffled up and down those aisles every weekend. Did they shuffle away finding what they wanted and needed?

The memorial program, which he figured had been tossed into a box somewhere for good keeping, had been tightly rolled up in his hands. He almost seemed to be strangling the thing as his hands clasped it, and kept is suspended between his knees. Fifteen minutes in to the ceremony, and he found that the had to perch at the edge of the pew. This kept his feet firmly planted on the floor, until he started to bounce on the balls of his feet. The roll ed up program jostled up and down as he did. His new brown shoes creaked around the toes as he did. 

From across the room, his younger sister made a few glances in his direction, but seemed largely concerned with friends from school and a few distant cousins who were closer to her age. 

Outside the church earlier, they all exchanged pleasant condolences. A few small children ran and play outside. They didn't understand at all what had just happened. They had just witnessed how fragile life really is, but their energy couldn't be contained any longer in the stiff stiches of their best outfits. One of his father's "old friends" corned him outside and talked about his family, his job, and his father in quick succession before tersely asking, "How are you?" before being absorbed into settling an altercation between his children over some toy or another.

"Then no one will have it!" the brother boomed. His voice drained the defiance from the children, and the younger one handed over the toy to his father. The older one turned to her father and said, "But what if something's broken?" she said.

"It's not broken!" objected the boy.

"You shouldn't be carrying around anything that important. I'm holding on to this until we get home."

By the time the conflict defused itself, people began moving on to their cars, or walking home if they lived close enough. The hearse had arrived, and a few members of the congregation materialized to transport his father. Nathaniel took this as a chance to escape inside one of the cars waiting for him and his brother and sister. He wasn't asked to be a pall bearer, so it was the duty of that strange, strange to him, at least, collection of men in suits of many sizes to carry the plain, black lacquered coffin.

When Lisa came through the door, he was completely drunk and not inclined to reminiscing anymore. "Where's your brother?"

"He's not here. Oh, I think something's really wrong."

"It's not that late. He'll be back."

"But what if he doesn't come back?" His sister was pacing in front of him.

"At least sit down. Have a drink..." he interupted himself with a sputtering laugh.

"Nathaniel, this is serious. Why are you so drunk anyway?"

"I was remembering things."

"Like what?"

"Dad's funeral."

"Oh."

"It doesn't matter now. None of it matters."

"What doesn't matter?"

"None of it. I mean, all of it. You know what I mean."

Lisa walked over and took the half nearly empty bottle of whiskey from the table and went into the kitchen. He sat there in the dim living room listening to the running water, plates cracking together from being dried and stacked.

In what seemed like mere minutes, his sister reappeared in the door and say, "I'm going to bed. I'm going to hope that Arthur comes home tonight."

"Don't worry he will. He will..."

He sat perfectly still for a while longer then decided to get himself up off the chair and do something. He walked up to the windows and pressed his face against the glass. The fall night had made the glass cold. The cold comforted him, made thing seem simpler. But what was on the other side of that cold glass? Nothing but the pitch black nighttime.

There was no sense of horizon or landscape. Maybe the flocking of a few trees in the distance. Nathaniel stepped back from the window and realized that he was agonizing over the decision whether or not to climb up to the airship. He didn't know why he was agonizing over it, but he was.

He heard creaking footsteps upstairs. That was the reason. He look around. And this place too. This was the reason. That rug, the chair, the lamp. The walls. The old pictures. Everything was trying to compell him to do something that he didn't want to do. In a fit of anger, he rushed to the sofa and grabbed the pillows, tossing them across the room. He kick at the sofa, sending it spinning across the floor. A lamp broke which sent a picture falling from the wall.

He pitched himself into a wall, bounced across to the other wall, then lunged forward to the front door. It gave way before him and he spilled out onto the front porch. He was coherent enough to get down the steps. From there, he was a drunk man staggering down a narrow country road. Heading who knows where.

Chapter 8
---------

No one left the police station that night. Every officer, on duty and off, stayed around talking about one topic: the airship. Pots after pot of coffee was brewed, thermoses filled and taken to the officers staffing the barricades that night. The police chief assigned one officer to watch the building, be up close and personal with it. "No more kids on the roof top," he said.

The police chief had been on the phone all day and into the night. Talking to reporters, confering with the state police. He had even gotten a call from the FBI. He doled out pieces of information as he got them. Everyone felt the importance of being the focus of so much attention.

The question on everyone's mind was, "Where did it come from?" Followed by "Will it blow up?" But after all of the conversation, no one had any answers. The consensus was that they were no under attack. No enemy forces had come pouring from the airship's cabin. Though why Briersville would be a strategic target was not broached.

The chief wouldn't comment if this was some kind of military experiment. Certainly no one from the military had shown up. But a few people in the station were convinced that this was an emergency preparedness excercise of some kind. Most of the other officers laughed this off, but everyone felt a twinge of uncertainty. Were they failing the test or not?

Officer Doyle rubbed his eyes at his desk. His desk chair could creak back to an angle that was almost suitable for sleep, but not quite. His head would bob then he would pitch himself forward.

Another police man, a younger fellow named Jim, passed by, "Bob, why don't you go home. You look exhausted."

"I'm fine. I'm fine." Being the first officer "on the scene" gave Doyle a special pride of place, made him something of an expert. He had already conferred with the chief for some time, detailing everything he had seen that morning. Unfortunately, none of it made much sense. He felt a duty, above and beyond that displayed by the other officers, to stay on the scene and see what might happen.

When he jerked awake with the chief standing him over him, he realized it might be time to go home. The chief had his tie undone and his coat thrown over his shoulder. "Bob, you need a rest. It's been a long one. Even I'm packing it in. Darlene threaten to divorce me if I don't get some rest."

Bob Doyle didn't have a Darlene at home to threaten him with legal action, but he took the chief's point. "No, you're right. It's been a day."

"Yep. Go on home Bob and get some shut eye. I asked John to write you out of tomorrow's schedule."

"Chief, I'll be fine. I'll be here tomorrow."

"Now, I can't stop you from showing up here, but you better not be in a uniform and you won't get paid for it. I mean it Bob. Who knows when this thing will end. Best to pace ourselves."

"Sure, sure."

He went to the locker room to change back into civilian clothes and headed out to his car. He lived in a boarding house on the western side of town. Getting home would be a bit complicated, though, because of the barricades. Maybe, he though, he'd swing a little wider out and pass by The Big House and get a drink. People at the Big House didn't seem to mind a cop from the neighboring town stopping in for a refreshment.

Going that way would take him by the Plaices. He wondered why Nathaniel had been so reluctant to help out with the airship. Seemed strange for a war hero to act that way when everyone in town needed him.

He headed south and connected up with county road A, which was a straight shot to the Big House, a roadhouse that sat just on the border between Briersville and Carlsburg. The road was long and straight and completely dark at this time of night. Not much traffic coming this way at night.

Driving made him realize just how tired he was. He slumped down a bit in the seat and leaned his head to the side on his shoulder. Then there was a man standing in the road ahead of him. Officer Doyle swerved and spun off the road and into a drainage ditch. Fortunately the ditch was dry and he was able to pull out and onto the side of the road.

He got out of the car. The man was still stumbling down the road, coming towards him. Officer Doyle grabbed a flare from his trunk, lit it and set in the middle of the road. He didn't want to be run down by another driver. 

He ran towards the stumbling man and realized that it was Nathaniel Plaice. "Nathaniel! Nathaniel! Get out of the road!" he shouted. But the Nathaniel didn't hear him.

By the time he caught up with him, Nathaniel had veered off into the field near the road. Officer Doyle approached him slowly and said, "Son, you're a little far from home."

"Am I? Couldn't tell."

"Yep. Why don't you come with me."

"Who are you?"

"Just a friend."

"Ah, I see you. You're a cop. Always the cops. One type of cop or another. You got no right coming in here."

"Coming in where?"

"My house..."

"Nathaniel, we're 5 miles from your house. It's the middle of the night and it's cold out here."

"Doesn't feel cold. It's not Riva Ridge or Mount Belvedere."

"No, it's not. Not that cold. But you don't have your gear. So, why don't you come with me."

"You're going to take me to jail."

"Probably."

"Nah." He took off running into the field. He ran straight into a fence though, got his clothes barbed on the wire, and tore the front of his shirt open getting loose. He ran back in Officer Doyle's direction. Officer Doyle squared up and attempted to tackle the drunken man, much as he might have tackled an aggressive corner back in high school.

Of course, that had been some years ago, and when he landed hard on his arm and shoulder taking Nathaniel down, he started to regret his decision. He suffed Nathaniel and led him back to his car. A truck barelled by, scattering the flame from the flare on the road. It sizzled and the car's headlights lit up the column of smoke that disappated in the sky.

So much for the Big House, he thought. He'd have to take Nathaniel back into town and book him. He wasn't even sure if he had the jurisdiction to do it, but it seemed unlikely that Nathaniel would argue with him. Nathaniel didn't talk during the car ride. Officer Doyle decided not to prod him for any conversation. Better to let this one pass by.

When they arrived at the station, Officer Doyle led him and put him in a cell. "Found him wandering on the side of the road. We'll let him sleep it off," he explained. He glossed over the detail of nearly running him down and spinning off the road. He didn't want to crucify the young man though. The other officers agreed with him. There were times when you could bend the rules and times you couldn't. It seemed clear to all of them that this was one of those times.

Now he really was tired and decided to go straight home. Home was a small room in a boarding house. The landlady, Mrs. Oliver, kept his rent low because she liked have a police officer in the house. She was an older woman, who carried herself the way Officer Doyle remembered his grandmother, a hard working woman who had spent most of her life in service. All that time in upper crust houses had imparted a "way of doing things" on his grandmother.

The other men living in the house weren't that bad. A few of them were down on their luck, but most were travelling salesmen, a young doctor who had just moved to town. A few factory workers, who had been floor managers. He only had to break up a scuffle once, and that had been over a girl. But Mrs. Oliver believed that his presence made the house more respectable, and doing so meant he could save a little extra money.

He planned to retire to a beach somewhere. Maybe in the Carribbean, maybe Cuba. A little money could go a long way down there. That's what he thought anyway.

The trade off was that he lived in a cramped room with a bed, a wardrobe, and sink. A few of the other rooms had desks, but Mrs. Oliver put a high school teacher and a librarian in there because they were "scholars."

"Promoting learning in my house isn't a bad thing, Officer Doyle."

"No, mam, I guess it's not."

"My late father held scholars in great reference. Do you know that he submitted frequently to the Oxford English Dictionary. He also worked on a biography of the early years of this town. I never saw the draft because he burned it. Claimed that his methodology was unsound. I always regret that all of that work went up in smoke. Can you imagine that, Officer Doyle?"

"What's that Mrs. Oliver?"

"Destroying your life's work like that. Not revising and correcting. But my father was a man of extremes. Take me for instance. I received the education that I have because my father didn't do things by halves. I showed an inclination in school and ended up going to a women's college."

Being a police officer meant he didn't get a desk in his room, but most days he didn't care. Especially on night like this. He would be waking up in just a few hours anyway. The chief wouldnt' keep him away from the station, especially with Nathaniel Plaice there.

Chapter 9
---------

The airship's cabin was cold, freezing cold. It didn't offer much more protection that if he'd been hanging from the side of the thing over the town. Getting into the cabin had been a challenge though. The girders were narrow. His hands and feet were freezing cold. He inched along until he reached the gangway that ran down the center of the ship to a ladder. 

He poked his head down into the cabin and looked around. Empty. The cabin had been completely empty. It wasn't even clear if anyone had been there. But how could anyone have been there. None of it made any sense. If he hadn't been so cold, Arthur would have assumed that he was dreaming.

Once he made it into the cabin, the airship seemed much more stable than it had when we was crawling along its skeletal frame. The clank of the metal under his feet was reassuring. He studied the primitive controls, really nothing more than ropes and levers stationed in front of a angled bank of windows. 

From those windows, he could look down directly to the street below. He felt like he was thousands of feet in the sky, even though he knew it was more like hundreds. What else was there to do up here? A radio would have been nice. He could call someone to rescue him. Surely someone would come to rescue him, eventually. If nothing else, someone would have to come up and figure out what was going on in the airship. What if there had been an injured pilot.

So, he walked around opening the cabin. There really wasn't much to do up here. So, he sat down, huddled up and waited.

Then the cold came. So much cold that he couldn't keep out. It seemed like an endless supply of cold would fill that cabin forever until he could see the first glimmerings of the sun off in the east. A few shafts of light colored the sky, then the sun's hot dome began to peek over the horizon. 

Arthur went from side to side, caught up in the beauty of the view. From up here, he could trace out the roads leading in and out of town. The creeks that wound their way through the country side, hunting for a river to connect to. Square patches of fields dotted the landscape like big blocks of paint, like abstract paintings he had seen in class. 

Land, land was everywhere he looked. But not just any land, this was the land that he known all of his life. But he had been down in it, or on it for so long, moving here and there without thinking much about everything else around him. Everything below seemed still and calm. The world was at peace with itself. For the first time in the few hours he had been up in the airship, he didn't regret taking the dare and climbing up. 

Once the sun came up, he started to want something for breakfast. The airship didn't seem to have much in it.. It wasn't as if he had not skipped a meal or two before. That's what running with Charlie and the guys meant sometimes. Charlie and Jeff really seemed to hold up their disjointed lives as a source of pride and envy. He and Nick were definitely the more "normal" kids, though Arthur didn't feel like he belonged in that category and more. At least Charlie and Jeff had parents, even if they didn't live up to the name.

"I wish I had a book," he said out loud. No one answered. He got up and poked around some more. There was a small navigation room behind the main cabin area and a mess behind that. There were a few berths built into the middle of the cabin as well. There wasn't much in the way of books, but he spent some time stuying the maps on the chart.

Most of the maps were old, places that were mostly cities now only showed up as a meeting place of a few winding roads. Probably highways around them now, Arthur thought.

His grumbling stomach interrupted him. He went back into the galley. It was very tidy. Every surface either had been meticulously cleaned or never used. It was hard to tell whcih was the case. He did find a few ancient looking cans. One seemed suspicously bent of our shape so he put it back. Besides, did didn't have a way to open them.

So, he gave up on the cans of food and let the hope that someone would come get him suppress his hunger.

As he sat there, dealing with the creeping feeling of hunger, he thought how funny it was that this was the highest in the sky he had ever been. At least that he remembered. His sister had told him before about a trip they took with their mother to see some distant cousins they had never met before then. They had travelled to a large airport and flown in the largest plane she had ever seen.

He remembered how the story had filled his sister's teenage with awe and wonder and excitement. But it had left him feeling nothing. He couldn't remember anything about the trip. It didn't help that the awe and wonder and excitement gave way to another key part of the story, the sad ending that followed. 

As she told it, this was the last time either of them would see their mother, who dropped them off at their relatives. Then their mother disappeared. Arthur could hardly remember her face anymore. But what did that matter? She had left and gone on somewhere. 

Then there was their father. His work as an engineer took him all over the world. But the children didn't go with him, at least Arthur and his sister didn't. Nathaniel was old enough and got to see the world. Then he left again for the Army and the war. Nathaniel had seen so much and Arthur had seen so little.

It was only fitting now, he thought, that he was the first and, so far, only person to experience being up in the "ghost ship," which was what he decided to call it. 

His parents were nothing but ghosts to him now. Their memory took up such a small part of him. Maybe it made him a bad person, to forget them the way he did. But they stepped back into the shadows, lingering behind heavy drapes that covered over these parts of his life. And it was no good to go and fight to have them uncovered. He flet that all the time.

Maybe this was why he found his borther and sister's responses to thier parents so odd and frustrating. Nathaniel just seemed to angry all of the time. Lisa was more cheerful, but always referenced some little phrase or a expression that their parents made, particularly their mother. She must have been concerned that he would forget the small things that start to make a person a real person, and not just a collection of observerable facts. No person could be put under a microscope and fully understood, no matter how many pieces you were able to unentangle from the whole and present to someone else as something complete and understandable.

He didn't have any of these reference points to go off of, only their extremem responses. He had to find his footing on broken and loose rocks of their own rememberances and relationships. So, he resented the feeling that he wasn't truly a part of them.

Now that the sun was up and the rush of getting aboard the airship had worn off, Arthur realized how tired he was. He lay down on the hard floor and closed his eyes. With the sun shining through the windows, the cabin grew warmer, which help ease him into sleep.

Chapeter 10
-----------

When she woke up and didn't hear any sounds in the house, Lisa started to panic and worry. She wrapped herself up in her robe and went downstairs. The house was completely empty, even after wandering about and shouting, "Nathaniel! Arhtur!"

She was worried about Arthur now more than ever. Normally, he would sneak back in late at night. She kept checking his room to see if he was in there, as if she had missed him the first five or six times she looked. 

Wandering around the house and the yard this way had half woken her up. She took a hot shower then made herself a proper breakfast. Sitting at the table eating an egg and toast and sipping at a cup of coffee, an indulgence that Nathaniel recenly started to allow her, she planned out what her day would be. She would need to go see the airship again to just make sure it was real and still there. Then she would look for her brothers.

But in the midst of this planning it dawned on her that she needed to go to school. She had a chemistry test and lab today. And there was a short paper due about Turn of the Screw that she needed to turn in today. She immediately felt angry at herself for forgetting about these mundane things, but how could she be expected to remember when there was an enormous airship hovering above town.

In fact, she wondered if school was cancelled. Her high school, the town's high school, was near downtown. Maybe they had closed the school. There was only one way to find out.

Since Nathaniel wasn't around to drive her to school, she would have to do it herself. The school bus didn't normally come by their house, so there was no sense in waiting around for that. She didn't technically have a driver's license yet, but these were kind of extraordinary circumstances. 

Lisa grabbed her school things. She got into their truck and headed down the road. 

Everything was cold and crisp that morning. The sun seemed particularly bright too. It was a beautiful morning, which she felt like she should appreciate more, but was too preoccupied with not stripping the shifter in her brother's green pick up truck.

She saw a police car up ahead, heading towards her. She sat up straight and tall and tried to look like she belonged behind the wheel. She resolved not to make eye contact with the police officer in the car, but as the car passed she couldn't help but look. It was one of the younger police officers on the force, whome she recognized as being one of her brother's friends from a long time ago.

The police officer made eye contact with her too. The car didn't turn on its lights though, so she assumed she was in the clear. She looked back in the rear view mirror and saw it swing around in a wide circle, kicking up dirt and dust from the side of the road as it did. Then the lights came on and Lisa realized that she was caught.

She pulled off to the side and waited for the car to catch up, which only took a minute. The car stopped and the police officer, whose name was... She couldn't remember. But when he stood next to her, she thought his name was Todd.

He seemed a little awkward to be a police man. He had every right to pull her over for driving without a license. Lisa nervously started talking, "I left my purse at home."

"What's that?" There was chatter on his radio.

"My purse. It's at home."

"No matter. I'm just surprised to have passed you by like this."

"Can I ask why?"

"I was coming to your house."

"Why's that?"

"It's your brother."

"Arthur, is he okay?"

"No, not Arthur. It's Nathaniel. And he's fine. He was taken in to the station last night to get a little clearer." Lisa didn't say anything. "I think you should come down to the station and be there when he wakes up. Seemed pretty out of it from what I heard."

"What happened?"

"Can't say exactly. But I don't think he was doing too well last night. Why don't you follow me into town."

"Oh, but I have to be at school and I have a test."

"I'll radio in and have someone contact the school."

Lisa wondered if this help was above and beyond Todd's duty as a police officer. He seemed genuinly concerned about her brother. She hoped that he wasn't really that bad off. She had seen him in some pretty dark places, particlarly in those early days when he came back home.

She still didn't really understand why coming back was such a bad thing. But he made it clear to both of them that he didn't want to be there. It made her cry many times. Nathaniel rarely had comforting words for her, and was more likely to say, "I'd be crying too if I were you." Arthur wasn't much help either. He started running with those deliquent guys and not being around as much as before.

It was strange how alone she had felt in those early days after her father died. He really was never around much, travelling all over the place. Their caretaker, a woman named Constance, lived with them and took care of them, only visiting her family on the weekends. But with more people around than ever, she felt very strongly how thigns had come apart. The people in her life seemed further apart than ever before.

As he followed behind the police car, her confidence behind the wheel surged. She pulled up in an empty parking spot, killed the engine, and hopped down the truck, wondering what lay in store for her inside the police stations.

Chapter 11
----------

When she woke up the morning after the airships's arrival, Briersville's mayor found a small gathering of people waiting for her on her front yard. No one noticed here peering down at them from a part in her curtains. PEople here were much too polite to start banging on her down. That had happened numerous times when she held offices in the city. 

She scanned the crowd as best as she could. There seemed to be a few shopkeepers, a few memebers of the city council, one of the powerful farmers and landlords in the area, and a few reporters. She couldn't tell just by watching them if they were waiting on her as a group, or if they had converged on her front porch by change.

She left the window and went to run her bath. While she sat on the edge of the tub letting water run over her hand, the phone rang. It was her assistant. "I think you should call a press conference earlier today. Let's try to get in front of some of these reporters and cameras that are coming in to town", the mayor's assistant said. He had been her campaign manager, in a town where no one had even considered that a mayor might need such a thing, and now was her "right hand."

He wasn't always such a great right hand, but having someone there, anyone really, made her look more powerful and that meant something to the mayor.

"We still don't have anything to say. Getting out ahead only to look confused won't help anyone."

"That's true. But not being seen, not talking about will be worse. Besides the police chief is taking over the spotlight. He's been mentinoed or interviewed in almost every story I've seen."

"There's people camped out on my front lawn. Seems like the press conference has come to me."

"We definitely need to schedule something. Don't go out there and talk to them."

"Don't worry, you can trust me to do the right thing." She knew and her assistant knew what this meant. She was going to go out there and talk to everyone. If nothing else, she liked flouting her handler.

After they got off the phone, she dipped down in the bath. Throughout her busy life she was always careful to relish the small things, to carve out time to do nothing and think of nothing. It certainly would seem that way to anyone observing her. Right now, though, her mind raced through several ideas of how best to proceed.

Not settling on any one course of action, she finished getting ready. Clothed and coiffed she moved to the phone, picked it up and asked for the police station.

"This is Mayor Thornsby. Can I speak to the police chief please? He's at home. I'll try there." She disconnected then asked for the chief at home. The phone range a few times before she heard a gruff, "Yeah."

"Chief?"

"Who is this?" He was probably surprised to hear a woman's voice on the phone. 

"This is the mayor, chief."

"Oh, Mayor Thornsby. Sorry, didn't get much sleep last night."

"I understand. I just have a small request to make of you, chief. A favor. More of an invitation."

"Yes?"

"Why don't you come to my house for breakfast this morning? My husband is away on business and I have a hankering for pancakes."

"Pancakes?"

"And coffee, of course."

The police chief paused. "I can be there in an hour or so."

"Take you time."

She hung up the phone and had a similar phone call with the fire chief. She would have to get to work, but fortunately Floria would be at her house soon to help out.

Soon enough the kitchen warmed up from the oven and stove running. The room smelled like bacon and butter and sugar. Floria arrived and helped flip pancakes and stow them in the oven.

The mayor checked in on her visitors in the yard. They seemed to be able to the smell the cooking coming from inside. She went back to brew coffee. By the time the two chiefs showed up at her house, she was ready to set her plan in motion.

When she saw the fire chief approaching, shaking hands in the yard, she opened her doors, strode out onto the porch and greeted everyone. "I have some coffee and breakfast inside if anyone is hungry."

Everyone from the yard filed into her house. They tipped their hats to her while Floria helped collect the coats. "It will be a little tight, but find a spot."

She made the rounds through her dinign room and kitchen with a large plate of pancakes. When those were gone, she went through with coffee then more pancakes. She kept herself busy until everyone was served. Then she sat down and started in on her breakfast too.

The din of talking in the room mixed with knives and forks clancking on her flatware. She sat next to the owner of the small department store downtown. He was concered about losing business while everything was shut down in the center of town.

"Can't we open things up a little bit?"

"Think of the risks right now," was her reply. "Give me a few more days, just enough time to collect all of the facts."

One of her guests was a reproter from the local paper. She overheard the reporter asking the chief about kids who had been caught on the roof of the building. The chief wisely said, "It was just a little mix up. We have it under control now." She had no idea of that was true, having just learned of the incident herself, but it sounded plausible enough.

Everyone talked about the airship in one form or another. The oldest in the room vividly remembered the age of the airship. An owner of a travel agency talked about booking a flight on the Hindenberg before it's last disasterous journey. Another man, who sat on the city council and sold insurance, remembered seeing the Graf Zeppelin when he was a boy.

The consensus in the room, if there could be said to have been one, was that the airship was part of some kind of military exercise. The fire chief seemed convinced of this. The fellows gathered around him nodded in agreement. Everyone had heard of the strange, secret projects that teh military developed. "They developed the bomb and no one knew much about that," said one of the listeners.

"If it's military," interjected the police chief, "then why haven't they come out and claimed it."

"Can't," said the fire chief. "Probably part of the exercise."

"Maybe we're being tested," said someone else. "Maybe the miliatary wants to see how we respond to the event."

"Like some kind of psychological experiment?" someone else asked.

The mayor realized that the conversation would quickly get out of control. It was time for her to assert herself. She tapped her fork against her coffee cup to bring the noise level down. Everyone stopped talking and faced her. Her assistant arrived just then too. He look utterly bewildered by seeing all of these people in the mayor's house, but realized what was happening and didn't lead on just how annoyed with her he was.

She, of course, knew how annoyed he was. She was straying from the plan. But so far, her gut always told her when to stray from the plan and when to stick to it. It hadn't been wrong yet and was a remarkably perceptive organ.

"Let's make some room for Ken. Ken, would you like some coffee?" He held up his cup as Floria came around with the warm porcellin pot.

"First, let's thank Floria for helping to make this wonderful food. And thank you for coming to my house this morning. I know you're here with questions and concerns. Now, understand, I don't have answers for everything. I think we're just getting over the shock of what happened yesterday. I can tell you this. I will do everything that I can working with the police and fire departments to ensure that the area aroudn the airship is safe and secure. I also want to commit to you to doing everything I can to learn what is going on and why the airship appeared in our town. I'm also going to to commit to you that within three days we will reopen downtown. Maybe not everything, maybe not the building where the airship is, but 90% will be open in three days."

Everyone nodded with approval, even the store owners who desperately wanted to reopen their shops.

"I'll work to make sure that we are compenstated for the lost business, but I can't make any promises. The other thing I want confirm is the the fire department will be going up to make sure that everything around the airship is struturally sound. I have real concerns about the stability of the radio town." OF course, the fire chief had no idea that he would be committed to doing this, but felt he had to smile through.

"Also we have a young man in town who has volunteered to climb up into the airship and inspect it for any potential problems. I won't give his name right now," she said, looking at the reporter. "But in a press conference later today, I'll say more about him. Now, if you don't have any more questions, there is a little more coffee left. So finish up. I have to take me leave and get some work down. See yourselves out when your done."

If she had to judge, she would have given the performance an 8 or so. She wasn't really prepared to sway them any further than she did. But she felt confident that every one of them in the group of visitors was a little more compliant and understanding than before.

She shook a few hands and made a few smiles then turned to go back upstairs. Everyone stood up as she did. The two chiefs followed her to the stairs. "Madam Mayor," said the police chief.

"Yes, chief?"

"You said some good things. I think they'll appreciate it. Just one little problem."

"What's that?"

"The young you mentioned hasn't been as cooperative as we had hoped."

"I did ask you to be creative, didn't I chief?"

"Yes you did."

"Why don't you just take a squad car and pick him up. Don't they do this in movies all of the time." REferencing the movies was a sure way to furstrate the chief, but he tried to take it in stride.

"The problem isn't that we don't have him."

"Good, then problem solved?"

"Not exactly. He was picked up late last night for drunk and disorderly. One of my men picked him and brough him in to sober up."

"And this is our shining hero citizen who will save us from our ignorance?"

"Yes, he is."

"And you still think he's the only man for the job."

"At least near by, yes, I think so."

"Very well then, give him a few hours to sober up, fill him up with black coffee, give him a shower, whatever it takes. We need him going up in that airship no later than tomorrow morning. I can give him jntil this afternon and then after that it's up the tower to the airship with him. You think he'll still be able to do it, right?"

The fire chief felt a little backed into a corner. "Yes, yes, well of course." "
